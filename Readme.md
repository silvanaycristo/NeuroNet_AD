## Project: Unraveling Alzheimer's Disease Through Information-Theoretic Network Analysis of Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing Data


### Description: 

This project aims to reconstruct gene co-expression networks using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data and information-theoretic approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study integrates transcriptomic profiling with network-based analysis to identify key regulatory modules and molecular pathways associated with disease progression. By leveraging best practices in single-cell analysis and multimodal data integration, the project seeks to uncover novel cellular vulnerabilities and dynamic regulatory changes contributing to AD pathology.


### Usage: 

To run this project, ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the required datasets are available. The scripts and pipelines provided in this repository are designed to process and analyze single-cell transcriptomic data, construct co-expression networks, and perform downstream analyses.


### Output: 

### Error handling: 

### Testing: 


### Data: 

This project utilizes the Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD), a multimodal reference atlas for Alzheimer’s disease, which provides single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus ATAC sequencing (snATAC-seq), and spatial transcriptomic data from human postmortem brain samples. The dataset includes transcriptomic profiles from different brain regions and AD pathology stages, allowing a detailed exploration of cellular heterogeneity and disease-associated gene expression changes.
